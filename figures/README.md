# Figures Directory

This directory contains generated figures and plots from the analysis.

## Organization

- Figures generated by scripts will be saved here
- Use descriptive filenames for figures
- Consider using version numbers or dates if you iterate on figures

## Note

Most figure files are excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`). 
If you want to commit specific figures to the repository, you can force-add them with `git add -f figures/filename.png`.
