# Source Code Directory

This directory contains the main analysis scripts and utility functions.

## Organization

- Place your Python scripts and modules here
- Use meaningful filenames that describe the purpose of each script
- Consider organizing into subdirectories if you have many scripts

## Example Structure

```
src/
├── preprocessing.py      # Data preprocessing functions
├── analysis.py           # Main analysis functions
├── visualization.py      # Plotting and figure generation
└── utils.py              # Utility functions
```
