# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization.

## Organization

- Use numbered prefixes for notebooks that should be run in sequence (e.g., `01_preprocessing.ipynb`, `02_analysis.ipynb`)
- Include descriptive names that explain the purpose of each notebook
- Add markdown cells to document your analysis steps

## Example Notebooks

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration and visualization
- `02_analysis.ipynb` - Main analysis pipeline
- `03_figures.ipynb` - Generate publication-quality figures
