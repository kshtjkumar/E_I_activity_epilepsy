# Network Level Shifts in E/I Balance During Chronic Epilepsy Revealed by Aperiodic EEG Dynamics

This repository contains code and analysis scripts for the paper "Network level shifts in E/I balance during chronic epilepsy revealed by aperiodic EEG dynamics".

## Overview

This repository hosts the computational analysis code and tools used in our research investigating network level shifts in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neural activity during chronic epilepsy, revealed through aperiodic EEG dynamics.
